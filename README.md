### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. In this lesson, I learned the difference between BOM and DOM. Browser Object Model: the browser object model, also referred to as BOM, is a convention that spcifies the objects, methods of the browser and properties. BOM is also responsible for containing the document object. 
2. Document Object Model: the document object model also known as DOM for short, is an object model made specifically for the document object. 
3. In this lesson I also learned the importance of the preview button. The preview button allows you to see the changes being made on the website as you edit the code at the same time. By having the preview page open it allows you to keep track of your work and make sure you are not making mistakes.
